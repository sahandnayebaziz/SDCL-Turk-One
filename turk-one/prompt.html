								Educational Traffic Flow Simulation Program
							</h5>

							<p><br>You are tasked with designing solution alternatives for a part of a traffic flow simulation program.
							</p>

							<p class="small">This program is not an exact, scientific simulation, but aims to simply illustrate the basic effect that
								traffic signal timing has on traffic. The part is described as a decision point which describes a specific
								aspect of the program that has to be designed. It is your task to design one or several alternative
								solutions
								for this decision point. The goal is to find design different designs that all meet the requirements for the
								decision point. Your designs will be evaluated according to the design criteria.</p>

							<p class="small"><span class="text-muted small strong"><strong>ASSUMPTIONS</strong></span><br>
								If you wish, you may assume that you will be able to reuse an existing software package that
								provides relevant mathematical functionality such as statistical distributions, random number generators,
								and
								queuing theory. In general, if you make any other assumptions please describe them in the solution
								alternative
								description.</p>

							<p class="small"><span class="text-muted small strong"><strong>CRITERIA</strong></span><br>
								Solution alternatives will be rejected if one of the following criteria is not met (the HIT will be rejected
								if none of the solution alternatives meet these criteria):
							<ul class="small">
								<li>No empty text fields</li>
								<li>No empty sketch canvas</li>
								<li>All text is in English</li>
								<li>Solution alternative must be relevant to decision point</li>
								<li>Solution alternative must be relevant to the User Interface design</li>
								<li>Solution alternative must be a feasible design for the decision point</li>
							</ul>
