									Educational Traffic Flow Simulation Program
								</h5>

								<p><br>You are part of a team of software developers who are working together to design a traffic flow simulator
									program. The overall purpose of the simulator program is educational: university-level civil engineering students
									will be using it to understand the effects that different traffic signal timings have on traffic flow.
								</p>

								<p class="small">The overall design problem has already been broken down into a large number of much smaller
									decision points: individual aspects of the design that can be considered in isolation of each other. You
									have been tasked with working on one of those decision points, by providing one or more alternative solutions
									that would satisfactorily address the requirements of that decision point.<br><br>
                                    <span id="description">{{DecisionPointText}}</span>
                                </p>

								<p class="small"><span class="text-muted small strong"><strong>CRITERIA</strong></span><br>
									You may provide as few as one alternative solution, and as many as five. You will be paid $1.50 per alternative solution that meets the following criteria:
								<ul class="small">
									<li>It is specified in English</li>
									<li>It has a proper name and textual explanation</li>
									<li>It has a sensible accompanying sketch that shows the alternative solution</li>
									<li>It is relevant to the decision point.</li>
								</ul>
